  bio: `I'm a passionate Flutter developer with experience crafting 
cross-platform mobile applications. My journey into Flutter has been 
driven by its expressive UI toolkit and rapid development capabilities.

I specialize in building production-ready apps with clean architecture, 
robust state management, and pixel-perfect designs. I've delivered apps 
that provide great user experiences across iOS and Android.

When I'm not coding, you'll find me contributing to open-source projects, 
writing technical articles, or exploring the latest in mobile development. 
I believe in writing code that's not just functional, but maintainable 
and delightful to work with.`,
