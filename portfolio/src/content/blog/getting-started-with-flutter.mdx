# Getting Started with Flutter Development

Flutter has revolutionized cross-platform mobile development, allowing developers to build beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

## Why Choose Flutter?

Flutter offers several compelling advantages:

- **Hot Reload**: See changes instantly without losing app state
- **Single Codebase**: Write once, deploy everywhere
- **Beautiful UI**: Rich set of customizable widgets
- **Strong Performance**: Compiles to native ARM code

## Setting Up Your Environment

First, you'll need to install the Flutter SDK. Here's how to verify your installation:

```bash
flutter doctor
```

This command checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation.

## Your First Flutter App

Let's create a simple counter app to understand Flutter's basics:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(const MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData(
        colorScheme: ColorScheme.fromSeed(seedColor: Colors.deepPurple),
        useMaterial3: true,
      ),
      home: const MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
  }
}
```

## Understanding Widgets

In Flutter, everything is a widget. Widgets are the basic building blocks of a Flutter app's user interface.

### StatelessWidget vs StatefulWidget

| Type | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| StatelessWidget | UI that doesn't change |
| StatefulWidget | UI that can change dynamically |

Here's an example of a StatefulWidget:

```dart
class CounterWidget extends StatefulWidget {
  const CounterWidget({super.key});

  @override
  State<CounterWidget> createState() => _CounterWidgetState();
}

class _CounterWidgetState extends State<CounterWidget> {
  int _counter = 0;

  void _incrementCounter() {
    setState(() {
      _counter++;
    });
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        Text('Count: $_counter'),
        ElevatedButton(
          onPressed: _incrementCounter,
          child: const Text('Increment'),
        ),
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have the basics down, explore these topics:

1. State management (Provider, Riverpod, BLoC)
2. Navigation and routing
3. Working with APIs
4. Local storage and databases

Happy coding! 🚀
